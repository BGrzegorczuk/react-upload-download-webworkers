- handle worker.postMessage callbacks || promise-worker library
- handle errors in the app, ex. no server connections, etc (for now, when there is no server working, worker gives some log, and then nothing happens)
- add some persistent db, ex. mongo

- handle case when uploaded already uploaded file - some different state of completed task? (differentiate in UI)
- add actions creators to maintain store - now nothing shows in the transfer list yet!


LOW LOW:

- Maybe file md5 should be counted only if no file with same name has been already uploaded? (optimization)
- fileToArrayBuffer syntax does NOT work in IE...
- workers can be initialized with parameters given as a constructor options to transferQueue. Now they imports consts file with for ex. CHUNK_SIZE, but that can be more customizable
- use immutable.js to handle tasks and directory tree collections in store?
